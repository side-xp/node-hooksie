# Contributing to this repository

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to a *Sideways Experiments* project!

At Sideways Experiments, we hate do the same thing more than once, and we love to share knowledge. Whether because you "just want to help" or share that generous laziness philosophy, you're welcome!

> This document is shared across most of our open source projects, which may refer to it. Any project that needs changes on the Code of Conduct has its own `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file at its root or in a `.github/` directory.

## Get involved!

There's many ways to be involved in our open source projects, and there's absolutely no pressure to give more or less of your time. So whether you want to develop the core of a whole package or just post a comment in an issue, any help is appreciated!

So what can you do to help?

- **Discuss with the community**: join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE), and start chatting with the community or the core team
- **Report bugs**: found a bug when using one of our packages? You can report it in the *Issues* tab on GitHub
- **Suggest improvements**: whether from the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE) or by creating an *Issue*, feel free to talk about your needs or current usage of our solutions, highlight what's missing or what could be better
- **Request new features**: again, you can use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE) or create a new *Issue* to ask for something new, see if others may need it to, so we can consider modifying an existinng package or even start a nw project just for it
- **Address issues**: you can contribute directly to the codebase by resolving an issue, creating the required assets, of just implement changes and create a Pull request on *GitHub*

## Code of Conduct

*Sideways Experiments* has adopted the [*Contributor Covenant*](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct for its open source projects, and we expect contributors to adhere to it.

## How to get help

For any question, suggestion, bug report or general discussion, you can either join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE) or create a new *Issue* on GitHub.

By the way, we love to know how you use our tools, so we can make them better!

## Reporting bugs

Did you find a bug or an unexpected behavior while using our solutions? PLease report it by following these steps:

1. Make sure you are using a recent version of *Node* (we don't support versions prior to v16)
2. Ensure the bug hasn't already been imported by searching it in the *Issues* tab on GitHub or discuss about it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE)
3. Create a new issue from the *Issues* tab on GitHub, and please provide as much details as possible, at least by filling the fields of our issue templates

The better you can describe your problem, the first it will be addressed!

## Suggesting enhancements or features

Feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bMK2d47JaE) or create an *Issue* to suggest an improvement or even request a new feature. Feel free to talk about your needs or current usage of our solutions!

We strongly encourage to open a discussion before implementing anything. Unsolicited pull requests for important changes or new features may be discarded "by default", as it may not be aligned with the library's scope or direction, or may bypass a convesation that would lead to a better alternative.
